            <h2>My thoughts of Visma challenge</h2>
            <div class="description">
              <p>At first I was a little bit shocked that this could be way too hard for me.
                Then I started reading what is actually the task and I breaked it into a smaller tasks.
                I started googling examples of this kind of programs and I realized that I have
                actually done something similar earlier in the school when we used APIs data.
                I just started writing code lines step by step and my first attempt it doesn't work at all. 
                I dive back to google to check how to break that url into peaces and it started to work a little bit more.
                Finally I'm very proud of my result and I trust more of my skills to learn new things in the future.
                This takes me about four hours to do. Mostly beacause of this kind of topic was a bit unfamiliar to me.
                Hope you liked it and I am excited to hear your thoughts about my topic.
