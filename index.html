            <h2>My thoughts of Visma challenge</h2>
            <div class="description">
              <p>First I was little bit shocked that this is way too hard for me.
                Then I start reading what actually is the task and I breaked it into smaller tasks.
                I started googling examples this kind of programs and I realized that I have
                actually done something similar earlier in school when we used APIs data.
                I just started doing step by step and first it doesn't work at all. 
                Back to google to  check how to break that url into peaces and it started to work little bit.
                Now I'm very proud of my result and I trust more of my skills to learn new things.
                This takes me about 5 hours to do mostly beacause this was kind of new thing to me.
                Hope you liked id and I wait to your response.
